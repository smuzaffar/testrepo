Things that need to be done for the event streaming output/input modules:

The TBuffer needs to become a data member of the class and SetBuffer
needs to be called for each event.

The input module is hard coded to read the streamed events from a file.
It needs to be converted to work like the output module - where the
network protocol driver is a template parameter.

The "AuxEvent" and the process history and not handled at all.

Each product in an event gets a copy of all the provenance information.
In the future, we may be able to send a table in the event header that
contains all the common provenance information and then reference it in
the per-product provenance information.

The StreamCopy/JunkCopy test configurations still do not run.  This
may be an environment issue, because JunkCopy test just uses the 
POOL output modules and input modules to do its work.
