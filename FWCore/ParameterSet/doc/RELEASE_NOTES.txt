Changed the exceptions from std::runtime_error to edm::Exception.
It is still unclear what the best route is for identifying
exceptions from this package.  Currently nearly all types
are edm::Exception with category "Configuration".  The constructor
message string includes "Invalid" or a string related to the 
place where the error occurred.  Another approach could be to
just use cms::Exception in a derived class, where the category
would be the derived class name and the message string could
be from a constructor argument.  This class could include
information in the message about the fact that this is
the parameterset package.  Currently many of the throw
exceptions include this information in the thrown data.
