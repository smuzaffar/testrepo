1 - Remove the mention of the fwkJobReports destination from the .cfi file:
    the affected lines are


untracked vstring fwkJobReports = {"FrameworkJobReport"}

      untracked PSet FrameworkJobReport = {
             untracked PSet default = { untracked int32 limit = 0 }
             untracked PSet FwkJob  = { untracked int32 limit = 10000000 }
                                           }

2 - By default no fwkJobReports destinations are created.

3 - Check for the command-line option --fwkjobReport or --fwkjobReport=<name>

4 - Equivalent options are -f or -f=<name>

5 - If --fwkjobReport=<name> appears, behave as if the .cfg file contained
    untracked vstring fwkJobReports = {"name"} (supplying the extension .xml 
    if it is not already present), with the defaults currently set in the
    .cfi file hardwired in to the code.  
    
6 - If --fwkjobReport (without specifying a name) appears, behave as if the
    precise lines which were exceised from the .cfi file were present, thus
    creating FrameworkJobReport.xml.
    
7 - If --fwkjobReport appears (with or without a name) AND the .cfg file 
    also has one or more fwkJobReports destinations, create all these 
    destinations plus the one caused by  --fwkjobReport.  (But if the name
    of the --fwkjobReport destination matches one of the explicitly specified
    names in the .cfg file, do not create the extra destination instigated
    by the comand-line option.
    
8 - An additional command-line option, --nofwkjobReport, causes the suppression
    of all fwkJobReports destinations, both those mentioned in a .cfg file and
    those mentioned in a --fwkjobReport option.
