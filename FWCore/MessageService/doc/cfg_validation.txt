	Design of validation for the cfg PSet for the MessageService
	---------------------------------------------------------

The following errors in configuring the message service 
should be detected and reported rather than  proceeding
with a job, because the mysterious behavior they cause
is too tough to track down by hand:

At the main level, only the following PSets are allowed:
  A destination, as listed in the vstring destinations 
  A category, as listed in the vstring categories or messageIDs
  One of the following keywords, which are valid as PSets at the main level
	default  
    	ERROR
    	WARNING
   	INFO
    	DEBUG

At the main level, only the following non-PSets are allowed:
    statistics		vstring
    destinations	vstring
    categories		vstring
    threshold		string	only certain values


	threshold



    limit		int
    reportEvery		int
    timespan		int


    placeholder		bool
    noTimeStamps	bool
    generate_preconfiguration_message		bool
    noLineBreaks	bool
    lineLength   	int
    fwkJobReports	string
    filename		string
    extension		string
    output		string
    reset		bool
    statistics		vstring
    destinations	vstring
    categories		vstring
suppressInfo     
 suppressDebug    
  suppressWarning
    debugModules
    

default (destination) should not have threshold -- OR BETTER, I shoudl allow it
to!  (But that is a feature change and I have to decide about clashes with
overall threshold) AHA: overall threshold is prefered if PSet is not used,
otherwise default threshold is prefered.   
Better:  Overall threshold is prefered always. 



Within a destination PSet, a PSet is declared which is none of the following:
  A category, as listed in the vstring categories or messageIDs
  One of the following keywords, which are valid as PSets at the main level
	default  
    	ERROR
    	WARNING
   	INFO
    	DEBUG
 
Within a destination PSet, only the following non-PSets are allowed:
	(list here)

The same rules apply for the default PSet at main level as for destination PSet.

Within a category PSet, only the following are allowed:
	(list here)

Within a severity pset, only the following are allowed:
    limit		int
    reportEvery		int
    timespan		int


In the destinations vstring, duplicate names.

In the destinations vstring, presence of both cerr and cout.

Use of filename or extension on cerr or cout.

In the statistics vstring, duplicate names, or cerr when destinations has
coout or vice-versa. 

In the categories vstring, duplicate names or names matching one of the
destinations or statistics or a keyword.  




 (which are valid in both the main level
  and the destination levle PSets):    
    limit		int
    reportEvery		int
    timespan		int
    placeholder		bool
    threshold		string	only certain values
    noTimeStamps	bool
    generate_preconfiguration_message		bool
    noLineBreaks	bool
    lineLength   	int
    fwkJobReports	string
    filename		string
    extension		string
    output		string
    reset		bool
    statistics		vstring
    destinations	vstring
    categories		vstring
suppressInfo     
 suppressDebug    
  suppressWarning
    debugModules
    
    
    
Any destination or category is used as anything other than a PSet


Use of wildcards with suppressInfo or suppressWarnig or suppressDebug not
allowed

Look at configure_errorlog to see how to send a message before configuration.
But that might not be best for this sort of message.
