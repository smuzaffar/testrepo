		Suppression of Messages in MessageLogger
		----------------------------------------

Basics of message suppression
-----------------------------

By definition, suppression of messages means that some subset of
messages issued by <LogWhatever> will never (in the case of multithread
operation) even be put on the queue for the MessageLoggerScribe thread
to look at.  (In single-thread mode, no calls to any messafge service logging
functions are made.)  

To suppress a message, the software must know, "at the top", that no message 
of this ilk can possibly be reacted to. 

For practical purposes, this has several consequences:

1. Savings of activity:  
   a. Overhead of adding to the queue, waking the scribe thread, consuming
      the message is eliminated.
   b. Preparation of the header and the extended message id never happens.
   c. Message is not "shopped" to the various destinations, saving 
      various map lookups.  This includes the statistics destinations.
   d. Of course no actual I/O or  is done. 

2. Granularity of choice:
   a. Suppression cannot distinguish between one destination and another.
   b. Suppression knows nothing about the category of the message.
   c. Suppression does know about the severity level of the message.
   c. Suppression CAN depend on which module is running.

3. Effect:
   a. A suppressed message cannot contribute to any statistics destination.
   b. There cannot be a way to over-ride suppression at the destination level.

Other configuration-specified preferences can cause various messages to be 
ignored by various destinations, but that is moot to the issue of suppresssion
because to decide to ignore a message, the destination has to see the message,
thus the message must have made it to the MessageLoggerScribe.

Suppression can be controlled by compile-time defines, by thresholds and
module specifications set up in the configuration file, or by a combination 
of both.  

Although by definition the activities above are elided, there is potential for
avoiding (or incurring) various other burdens.  In particular, the message
content itself might take non-trivial time to build up.  It is desirable that
in the case of a suppressed message, this work be avoided:

4. Further savings of activity:
   a. The various operator<<'s appearing in the message-issuing statement  
      are not executed.
   b. Any functions called to prepare for those operator<<'s are not called.
   
If suppression is dictated by a compile-time define, then a fifth savings can 
be imagined:

5. Savings of space:  
   a. The code for the various operator<<'s and or functions appearing in the 
      statement issuing the message does not even apear in the executable.  

The non-execution of functions appearing in a statement involving a 
suppressed LogDebug, while quite desirable to our community, violates C++
semantics about expression evaluation.  The user "has a right to expect"
that in A(b) << foo(), the function foo() is called and any side effects
will happen.  Creating a situation in which these semantics are violated 
can be accomplished via a pre-preocessor macro or define (and I suspect 
ONLY that way).  The reason we are somewhat comfortable with this violation 
of C++ expression evaluation semantics is that this is the identical situation
occuring in the context of the assert macro.  Users are familiar with the fact
that using a function with side effects inside an assert is poison, and 
nobody takes arms against the writer of assert on that issue.

Status before Sep 2010
----------------------

In the original idea for LogDebug, a compile-time define would cause LogDebug 
to become a complete no-op, resulting in code that was identical to the code 
with the LogDebug statement commented out.  This turned out not to be as easy 
as originally anticipated, and indeed the original code missed the mark in
(at least) two ways:

1. When the suppression was specified at compile time, the code for 
   functions needed to prepare the data composing the message was still
   being generated, and the code implementing the functions to prepare 
   the message was still being executed, because the Suppress_LogDebug_ class 
   was still doing operator<<, treated in this way:
   
    Suppress_LogDebug_ &operator<< (T const & t) { return *this; }	
    
   That implies that if the rhs of the operator<< is foo(), then foo() must
   be called since from the compiler's perspective foo() might have side 
   effects. 

2. When the suppression was specified dynamically, the compiler inherently 
   could not avoid generating the code for foo(), but it also would be 
   executing foo(), and that (wee shall see) could have been avoided.

Although some care was taken to expose, by inlining, as much of the mechanism 
as possible so that a good compiler could know to throw everything away, the 
compiler does not know (and cannot be told) that the individual streaming 
operators and/or the functions called to compute the data being streamed are 
"pure."   Empirically, therefore, LogDebug occupied non-negligible time (in 
some cases) even when suppressed.

The solution to this dilemma, at least for the compile-time case, lies in
a lexical technique suggested by C. Jones.  This forces the pre-preocessor to
generate a statement such that the possibly-expensive function and operator<< 
calls are REQUIRED (by the C++ standard) to be elided by the compiler.

In the dynamic case, the solution is to not to leave the realm of the
macros until after the decision-point about suppression.  This complicates
matters due to the two-levels of macro, but is not conceptually any different.

Given that LogDebug() behaves logically like a ctor, it is less than 
trivial to implement these techniques; more about that below in the Coding 
Details section.


Details of how suppression booleans are maintained
--------------------------------------------------

I will use edm::LogInfo as an example; the WARNING level loggers behave
similarly, ERROR level messages cannot be suppressed, and LogDebug has a 
special macro structure discussed below for placing the line number into 
the message.

Let's start from the business end (how the suppression boolean is used)
and trace back to see how it is modified and finally how it is set up
and how modification policy is established.

The variable obtained by edm::MessageDrop::instance()->infoEnabled 
is the relevant suppression boolean.  It is used in the ctor of LogInfo
to decide whether to initialize an auto_ptr to a MessageSender with
an actual MessageSender, or with 0.  

In MessageLogger/interface/MessageLogger.h:
class LogInfo				
{
public:
  explicit LogInfo( std::string const & id ) 
    : ap ( edm::MessageDrop::instance()->infoEnabled ? 
      new MessageSender(ELinfo,id) : 0 )
  { }
// ...
}

The act of destroying the MessageSender, which occurs when in the dtor of
LogInfo this auto_ptr is destructed, is what triggers preparation of the
ErrorObject and placing that ErrorObject onto the MessageLoggerQueue.  
That is, if the MessageSender is constructed, then INEVITABLY the message 
will appear on the queue, and such a message by definition was not suppressed.

How does edm::MessageDrop::instance()->infoEnabled evolve?

If we look in MessageService/src/MessageLogger.cc (note that the other header
we looked at was in MessageLogger, not MessageService), we see that various
calls to the following helper functions are set up as callbacks:

establishModuleCtor  is called by
  preModuleConstruction
  preSourceConstruction
  
unEstablishModule is called by 
  preModuleConstruction
  preSourceConstruction
  
establishModule is called by
  preModuleEndJob
  preModuleEndRun
  preModuleEndLumi
  preModule
  preModuleEndLumi
  preModuleEndRun  
  preModuleEndJob
      
unEstablishModule is called by
  preModuleEndJob
  preModuleEndRun  
  preModuleEndLumi
  preModule
  preModuleEndLumi
  preModuleEndRun  
  preModuleEndJob
  
So we see that whenever code for some module is running, establishModule
with that module descriptor will have been called.

In establishModuleCtor and establishModule, values are set up for 
messageDrop->debugEnabled, messageDrop->infoEnabled, and warningEnabled.

The code first searches for this moduleLable() (label, not name) in the map 
suppression_levels.  If it fines a suppression level for this module,
then it sets each of enabling variables (for example infoEnabled) true if 
the indicated supression level is less than the corresponding severity level.
For example, if suppression_levels["thisModule"] = ELsev_info (or higher),
then infoEnabled is set false; if it is ELsev_debug then infoEnabled is
set true.  If the module label is not found in the list, then  infoEnabled
and warningEnabled are true.

Current code (as of 9/17/10) treats debugEnabled differently:  First,
it sets up debugEnabled according to two booleans anyDebugEnabledand
everyDebugEnabled (the usage is the obvious) and the map
debugEnabledModules_ (if the bools don't settle the issue and the map 
contains the module lable, then debugEnabled is set true).  Then if 
the suppression_levels map dose not contain this module label, that 
value of debugEnabled is left holding.

When the module is unEstablished, the value goes back to the original
infoEnabled, as stored in nonModule_infoEnabled (similarly for the others.
nonModule_debugEnabled, nonModule_infoEnabled, and nonModule_warningEnabled 
are given initial values (false, true, true) as a matter of good C++ practice, 
but these initial values are not used.  On the other hand, initial values of
messageDrop->debugEnabled, infoEnabled, and warningEnabled  (which are relevant
for messages issued outside of all modules) are set true in MessageDrop.cc.

So far, we see that infoEnabled is used to decide whether to create a 
MessageSender, and that infoEnabled is established each time a module is 
entered, based on suppression_levels.  All that remains is to see how
suppression_levels (and, for logDebug, anyDebugEnabled, everyDebugEnabled, 
and debugEnabledModules_) get set up.

In MessageLogger.cc, the ctor of MessageLogger sets suppression_levels
based on the three vectors suppressDebug, suppressInfo and suppressWarning.
Each of those, in turn, were obtained as a vstring from the configuration
(parameters "suppressDebug", "suppressInfo", and "suppressWarning").
Similarly, debugEnabledModules_ is obtained from debugModules, which is
obtained from the vstring parameter "debugModules".  anyDebugEnabled is
set based on debugModules being empty, and if this is the case, 
MessageDrop::debugEnabled  is also set false (which will be relevant 
when outside of all modules). Finally, if any of the values in debugModules
is "*", then everyDebugEnabled_ is set true.
   
Current (until Sep 2010) LogDebug Suppression
--------------------------------------------

The code defining the (macro) LogDebug looked like this:

#ifdef EDM_MESSAGELOGGER_SUPPRESS_LOGDEBUG 
#define LogDebug(id) edm::Suppress_LogDebug_()
#define LogTrace(id) edm::Suppress_LogDebug_()
#else
#define LogDebug(id)                                 \
  ( !edm::MessageDrop::debugEnabled )                \
    ?  edm::LogDebug_()                              \
    :  edm::LogDebug_(id, __FILE__, __LINE__)
// ...

class Suppress_LogDebug_ 
{ 
public:
  template< class T >
    Suppress_LogDebug_ &operator<< (T const & t) { return *this; }	
};  // Suppress_LogDebug_

This implies that **even if debugEnabled is false** a line like

LogDebug ("cat") << foo(objectA) << objectB;

will force the compiler, to properly execute any side effects of operator<<
and of foo(objectA), to do the operator<<'s and to call foo(), even though 
the user's intent was surely to skip them.  While operator<<, taken from
SuppressLogDebug_, is trivial, foo() probably is not.

Similarly, if debugEnabled is false when LogDebug is not suppressed by the 
define, then even though no MessageSender will be created, the operator<<
and foo() calls to construct the message still will be executed.  

Placing line numbers into a message
-----------------------------------

In order to place line number and source file name into a message, 
the LogDebug token **must** be a macro -- nobody is interested in
the line and file of the place in MessageLogger.h or .cc that the
ctor of some LogDebug class appears.

In retrospect, it was this forcing of the usse of a macro that enticed 
us to provide assert-like behavior in terms of eliding LogDebug in the
debug-disabled case.  For code in the MessageFacility package, where users
have requested forms of LogInfo etc. having line numbers and file names,
this same issue will arise again, and we should carefully think out what
we and theusers want to do. 

Coding details in moving to optimal suppression
-----------------------------------------------

For LogDebug (and LogTrace) ONLY we wish to have a general suppression 
variable which does not do anything with the messageDrop singleton and 
is controlled solely by a define.  

The goal is to prevent the execution of operator<< and foo(), and ideally to 
prevent even the inclusion of non-executed code for the operator<< and foo(), 
when the user does something like

  LogDebug ("cat") << foo(objectA )<< objectB;

and the LogDebug is suppressed.  Part one of this goal is to achieve that
optimization when the information indicating suppression is via a macro.
Part two is to (if we can) achieve the optimization under control of a 
run-time variable.

The trick for part one (suggested by C. Jones) exploits the lexical 
properties of the preprocssor, to constuct a statement that contains
a ?: conditional, with the predicate being compile-time true, and the
operator<< constructs coming out as the tail end of the (unexecuted)
if-false statement. Thus:

  #define LogDebug(id) true ? edm::SuppressLogDebug() :edm::SuppressLogDebug() 

such that the user statement becomes 

  true ? edm::SuppressLogDebug() :edm::SuppressLogDebug() 
				  		<< foo(objectA) << objectB;

and this is equivalent (known at compile time) to

  edm::SuppressLogDebug();

which, we notice does not even contain the code for foo(objectA) or any
operator<<.

Part two can also be accomplished, although in that case the code for the
operator<<'s and foo() obviously will be generated.  Consider the 
following two-tier construct.
  
  #define MIGHTSUPPRESSLOGDEBUG(id) disabling_variable ? \\
          SuppressLogDebug_() ? LogDebug_(id)

  #ifdef DISABLING_SYMBOL 
  #define LogDebug(id) true ? SuppressLogDebug_() : SuppressLogDebug_() 
  #else
  #define LogDebug(id) MIGHTSUPPRESSLOGDEBUG(id)
  #endif
					  
Then if DISABLING_SYMBOL is true, the user statement becomes					  

  true ? edm::SuppressLogDebug() :edm::SuppressLogDebug() 
  						<<foo(objectA) << objectB;

which we already saw satisfies the part 1 goal.  If DISABLING_SYMBOL is false,
the user statement becomes

  disabling_variable ? edm::SuppressLogDebug_() 
  : LogDebug_(id) << foo(objectA) << objectB;
  
Clearly, if disabling_variable is false, you get the proper LogDebug_ call with
the associated streaming.  If disabling_variable is true, you get a ctor of
SuppressLogDebug_() as the entire statement; the anonymous object immediately
goes out of scpe when tthe statement ends, and thus nothing is done.  So this
satisfies part two.  

We should choose symbol names that are appropriate for the CMS EDM, of course.
It has already been specified that the define the user sees to enable 
LogDebug should be EDM_ML_DEBUG.  Since this is now to be disconnected from
NDEBUG and other such symbols, we can use it directly.  The  
MIGHTSUPPRESSLOGDEBUG is an internal to the MessageLogger, but those too
should start with EDM_ML_; a good name is EDM_ML_ENABLED_LOGDEBUG.  But we
don't even need that extra level of "indirection" since we are already 
going to a #define for LogDebug(id).  So the code will look like:

  #ifndef EDM_ML_DEBUG 
  #define LogDebug(id) true ? edm::SuppressLogDebug_():edm::SuppressLogDebug_() 
  #else
  #define LogDebug(id) \\
  	!debugEnabled ? edm::SuppressLogDebug_() : \\
	 edm::LogDebug_(id, __FILE__, __LINE__) 
  #endif

Effect on "message blocks"
--------------------------

A technique recommended if the user needs to prepare a message in a loop
or with conditional code looks like:

  if (isInfoEnabled()) { 
    edm::LogInfo m("cat");
    for (i=0; i<imax; ++i) m << foo(i);
  } // m goes out of scope, causing the message to be sent.
  
Let's see what happens when we use that with LogDebug instead, in light of 
these macros.     

  if (isDebugEnabled()) { 
    LogDebug m("cat");
    for (i=0; i<imax; ++i) m << foo(i);
  } // m goes out of scope, causing the message to be sent.
  
becomes  a pre-processing error whether or not EDM_ML_DEBUG is defined 
(since LogDebug is a macro requiring an argument, but LogDebu m("cat")
breaks that up at the m).

We will need to recommend a different mantra for LogDebug.  The following
will probably work:

  #ifdef EDM_ML_DEBUG
  if (isDebugEnabled()) { 
    edm::LogDebug_ m (LogDebug ("cat"));
    for (i=0; i<imax; ++i) m << foo(i);
  } // m goes out of scope, causing the message to be sent.
  #endif
  
If EDM_ML_DEBUG is defined that becomes 

  if (isDebugEnabled()) { 
    edm::LogDebug_ m (edm::LogDebug_("cat", __FILE__, __LINE__));
    for (i=0; i<imax; ++i) m << foo(i);
  } // m goes out of scope, causing the message to be sent.
  
while if EDM_ML_DEBUG is not defined that becomes nothing at all.

We will need to document this technique difference for LogDebug.

By the way, it may be right to inline the functions isDebugEnabled(), 
isInfoEnabled() and isWarningEnabled(), to make this quicker, but that
is a separate issue.


Possible further improvement opportunities
------------------------------------------

The initial value of MessageDrop->debugEnabled (in MessageDrop.cc) is
true.  This is perhaps relevant in cases where debug is overall enabled,
and one is not in any module.  So you run with debug on, and if the 
framework itself has :ogDebugs in it, you can't suppress them without
suppressing all debug messages.  It might be better to make this false.
(Trivial change to make.)  It might also be desirable to have some way
to turn on/off non-module LogDebugs.  However, this issue is very likely 
moot since users don't write non-module code, and probably framework 
people are not leving LogDebugs around.

There is presently no mechanism to disable LogInfo if all thresholds are 
higher than logInfo, and similarly for logWarning (not sure if the issue
is relevant for logDebug).  This could be a huge savings.  Not easy to do,
but should not be too tricky.
