Atlas of MessageLogger tests

u1	Gives different thresholds to multiple destinations, and assigns
	limit=0 to annoying message categories preEventProcessing and FwkJob.
	Incidnetally tests noTimeStamps.  Also generates a job report file
	(u1_job_report.mxml).   
	---------- UnitTestClient_A

u2	Tests handling of a message generated pre-configuration, by using the
	special generate_preconfiguration_message parameter in the cfg file.
	---------- UnitTestClient_A

u3	Generates a plain-vanilla statistics destination (not matching any 
	output destination).
	---------- UnitTestClient_A

u4	Generates a pair of statistics destinations but assigns a different 
	file name for one of them (other than the pset name) anda threshold for
	the other.
	---------- UnitTestClient_A
	
u5	Tests reset versus no reset behavior when multiple statistics 
	summaries are triggered.  (That is, if untracked bool reset = true 
	then the next time statistics are triggered, they start from having
	been cleared the last time the sumary was sent out.)
	---------- UnitTestClient_B

u9	Tests behavior when using the official MessageLogger.cfi.
	---------- UnitTestClient_G

u10	Use of  extensionless filenames
	---------- UnitTestClient_C

u11	reportEvery, and some overall defaults
	overall defaults regarding reportEvery
	overall defaults for all destinations, for unnamed categories 
	overall defaults for all destinations, specific category     
	default reportEvery for a destination superceding overall default                    
	default reportEvery for a destination not superceding 
		specific category overall default 
	reportEvery for specific category superceding both defaults                            
	reportEvery and limits interacting with each other
	---------- UnitTestClient_F
	
u12	Tests the placeholder feature. 
	---------- UnitTestClient_A

u13	Tests LogVerbatim and LogTrace
	---------- UnitTestClient_H

u14	Message suppression by severity and by module.  For example,
	suppressInfo = { "sendSomeMessages", "source" }
	Does not test suppressInfo = "*" or any excludeModule or such.
	---------- UnitTestClient_I

u15	LogVerbatim and LogTrace; also whether isInfoEnalbled() works
	when it is enabled.  
	---------- UnitTestClient_H
	
u16	Explicit specificatoin of filenames and of extensions in destinations,
	statistics, and jobReports.
	---------- UnitTestClient_A
	

	
<This Atlas is not yet complete; will add to it.>
	
u22	Tests effect of LogFlush by cfg-configurable choices of how many 
	messages to use to clog the queue and whether or not FlushMessageLog
	is invoked.  Under normal testing, it will invoke FlushMessageLog in
	a situation where its absence would result in different output.
	---------- UnitTestClient_P

u23	Tests effect of LogFlush by GroupLogStatistics(category) 
	by having 6 differently labeled modules (of two distinct classes)
	all of which issue LogIssue with two "grouped" categories.
	---------- UnitTestClient_Q

u24	Behavior when duplicate file names are supplied.  We create two
	destinations, with ERROR and WARNING thresholds, and force the
	files both to be u24.log.
	---------- UnitTestClient_A
