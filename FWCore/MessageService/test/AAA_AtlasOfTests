Atlas of MessageLogger tests

u1	Gives different thresholds to multiple destinations, and assigns
	limit=0 to annoying message categories preEventProcessing and FwkJob.
	Incidnetally tests noTimeStamps.  Also generates a job report file
	(u1_job_report.mxml).   
	---------- UnitTestClient_A

u2	Tests handling of a message generated pre-configuration, by using the
	special generate_preconfiguration_message parameter in the cfg file.
	---------- UnitTestClient_A

u3	Generates a plain-vanilla statistics destination (not matching any 
	output destination).
	---------- UnitTestClient_A

u4	Generates a pair of statistics destinations but assigns a different 
	file name for one of them (other than the pset name) anda threshold for
	the other.
	---------- UnitTestClient_A
	
<This Atlas is not yet complete; will add to it.>
	
u22	Tests effect of LogFlush by cfg-configurable choices of how many 
	messages to use to clog the queue and whether or not FlushMessageLog
	is invoked.  Under normal testing, it will invoke FlushMessageLog in
	a situation where its absence would result in different output.
	---------- UnitTestClient_P
