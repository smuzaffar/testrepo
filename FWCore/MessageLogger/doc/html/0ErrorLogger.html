<p>
The ZOOM Error Logger package is meant to meet the needs of Run II (D0 and CDF)
offline (and possibly higher-level online) code for a unified message logging 
and statistics facility.

<p>
This package provides:

  <ul>
    <li> Uniform formatting of log messages
    <li> Central control of logging to multiple destination logs
    <li> Throttling by severity of messages to each destination
    <li> Setting limits on appearances (by message id) of each sort of message
    <li> Error statistics by message id, module, and subroutine
    <li> <font color=red>
	Collective (multiprocess) error reporting </font>
	(with the user supplying the communications mechanism)
    <li> <font color=red>
	Error message history</font>, via a filtered list of ErrorObj's.
    <li> 
	<a href="../../../ZMtools/doc/html/0assertN.html">
	Assertion macros </a>
	reporting via error messages
  </ul>

<p>
Some design points of this package are 
  <ul>
   
   <li> The semantics of providing information to a log message are those
   	of streaming objects into the log.  Thus the full power of the
	&lt&lt mechanism for any object that may be sent to an ostream is 
	available.
	<ul>
	<font color=red>
	Here is a <a href="brief.html">very brief description</a> 
	of how users issue messages for the log.
	</font>
	</ul>
   <li> It is assumed that most of the time, messages are not being logged.
	The burden in time incurred by the presence of the mechanism is kept 
   	absolutely minimal in such circumstances.
   <li> Much attention has been paid to the potential for use in the D0 Level 2
	environment, in which efficienciy considerations are extreme and 
	notable restrictions are placed on C++ feature usage.  The design
	is such that customization for that purpose can be done with maximal
	retention of the ErrorLogger code.
  </ul>
<p>
Although this package did not start out with a design goal of becoming a
not a multi-process message gathering mechanism, the 
<font color=red><code>ELcollected</code></font>
destination allows an experiment to set up collective error message handling,
based on whatever communications mechanism they choose to employ.
Given this collection mechanism, the need for a "circular save buffer" 
(which had previously been called <b>ELsaveBuffer</b>) is also greatly 
simplified.  
The necessary functionallity is met by a destination 
<font color=red><code>ELerrorList</code></font>,
which places error objects onto a user-accessible std::list.
<p>

This package may be obtained from the following sources:

  <ul>
    <li>
      The ZOOM reference copy
      is located on the Fermilab <b>fnalu</b> Unix cluster
      (for example, on <code>fsgi02.fnal.gov</code>),
      in directories rooted at
      <a href="../..">
      /afs/fnal.gov/files/reports/working-groups/fpcltf/Pkg/ErrorLogger</a>.
    <li>
      For CDF or D0 users,
      a reference copy is maintained in the standard CDF or
      D0 manner on their respective Unix systems.
    <li>
      The package is kept in a CVS repository managed by SoftRelTools.
      A file <a href="../../../cvs.setup">cvs.setup</a>
      provides a script for setting up this and/or other ZOOM products.
  </ul>

There is also a mechanism for integrating the
