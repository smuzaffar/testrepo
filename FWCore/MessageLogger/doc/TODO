To Complete Phase 1
-------------------

Guide to Issuing CMS MessageLogger Messages

Finalize decision on  whether to hoist LogWarning etc to not be in 
edm namespace (JBK likes it the way we have it).

If no destinations attached, re-enable cerr.

		
Decide whether debug is lowest or highest level.  (Have Jim's statement that
it is lowest.)

Add string name for debug's severity of DEBUG to map.



Known for Phase 2
-----------------

statistics destination(s) 

Destination connecting to log4cplusplus - or discussion about that with
CMS and decision on what to do instead.

Information order (is time etc first or last...)

Default behaviour (particularly destination) if none provided.


			Recommended options

Way to incorporate Module name


ErrorLogger has a scheme for establishing debug verbosity levels and
discriminating about whether a given message will be rapidly discarded
based on the level assigned. The LogDebug mechanism should be able to 
exploit that scheme.
